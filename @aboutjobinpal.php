  <meta name="description" content="Jobinpal is an application that will help students to connect to companies, we believe that the students are supposed to be looked upon by the companies not the reverse, we also think that valuable students should be bidded for just the same system applied to sporting players transfer, this will increase the demand and increase the value of students to companies, We majorly believe that Entrepreneurs are the Key players in every Growing economy, So our Goal is to create more entrepreneurs to the diffrent sectors in every country. The Curriculum Vitae is a way to summarize the student performance but we believe with a more bigger data, companies can tell the performance of the student and before they employ the student. Lastly we believe that a if a dollar was contributed by everyone to everyone, Everyone should a billionaire by now, So we see the students as the future of every economy and to achieve that we believe the student should be given a crowd raise to support him as a worker to the job market. We believe this a simple but classic idea for Jobinpal, Support us to make this not just an application but a way of life (A new culture) 'to connect students to companies' that is our vison. ">

      <h5 class="text-justify raleway-font">
        As newly grad students, we have come to notice companies show little or no interest in students. Although itâ€™s true some actually sponsor some scholars while in school, its also true that they have failed to closely follow-up on the progress of these students  in their various institutions. We at Jobinpal believe in the students and Companies should do the same. For that, we have created a platform that should connect students with same mind and goals, of same and different institutions and likewise focus companies attention on students to help integrate these students who would one day graduate and become a workforce into their various dream professions. We believe Entrepreneurs are very important for the development of the economy and impact positively into the lives of people around them through job creation. The connection between students no doubt we see to a large growth in Entrepreneurs. The platform gives students the opportunity to sell themselves to their aspiring employers for those looking forward to working in their aspiring companies as its a 'LIVE' Curriculum Vitae. It shows the academic  progress made by the student.  This is what We in Jobinpal Believe. This is our Vision.
