  <meta name="description" content="Jobinpal is an application that will help students to connect to companies, we believe that the students are supposed to be looked upon by the companies not the reverse, we also think that valuable students should be bidded for just the same system applied to sporting players transfer, this will increase the demand and increase the value of students to companies, We majorly believe that Entrepreneurs are the Key players in every Growing economy, So our Goal is to create more entrepreneurs to the diffrent sectors in every country. The Curriculum Vitae is a way to summarize the student performance but we believe with a more bigger data, companies can tell the performance of the student and before they employ the student. Lastly we believe that a if a dollar was contributed by everyone to everyone, Everyone should a billionaire by now, So we see the students as the future of every economy and to achieve that we believe the student should be given a crowd raise to support him as a worker to the job market. We believe this a simple but classic idea for Jobinpal, Support us to make this not just an application but a way of life (A new culture) 'to connect students to companies' that is our vison. ">
